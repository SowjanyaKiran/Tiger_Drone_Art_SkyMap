# 🐅 Tiger Drone Art

This project recreates a **tiger image** using **drone position data** stored in a CSV file.  
Each point represents a drone's location, plotted and animated to form a tiger shape in the sky.

## 🚀 Features
- Reads drone coordinates from a CSV file
- Normalizes and visualizes positions
- Generates a tiger image formation
- Supports animation for flight simulation

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization and animation)

## 📂 Input Format
`tiger_drone_positions.csv`
```csv
x, y
120, 200
130, 210
...

A Python project that visualizes and regenerates a tiger image from drone position data stored in a CSV file. Uses Matplotlib and NumPy to simulate how drones could form a tiger shape in the sky.
